the center of midfield wasn't great
The number of passes made which reached a player tonight Embarrassing
is a dirty Scouse bastard Can we look at that instead of wanking on about the penalty
you dirty little man 
kicks the shit out of
could indecently assault an elderly lady at old trafford and still nothing will be made of it 
Jammy bastards talk about luck deserting again eh The ref biased a dirty bastard too
is a scouse cheating twat in every possible way 
How has  not been sent off  The ball was long gone 
How is even still on the field for  He's been utter shite Can only seem to pass to a opposing player
Is really a footballer 
is a waste period
produce countless unforced errors
you bellend Offside
Finishing needs work Especially
bad performance in this first half
Did nothing except scoring
I think has issues probably with his girlfriend or something He lacks concentration on the pitch Awful performance today
Very strange performance from The things he was bad at passing control he's done well His best asset (finishing) atrocious
all wasteful
Poor performance were all underwhelming for most of the game Esp
is having a fucking nightmare all he needs is a red card to top off his performance
blatantly kicked
Poor performance from united miss big time Lacking a leader
overall were poor can't see them going far on that performance badly missed
bad performance from united in 1st half I hope be better in 2nd half what happened 
is such a stupid ass why not play earlier & take out He can even 10 men  IS A FOOL
Crazy Penalty Awarded 
He dived
Referee in the game had an absolute mare
He was horrible
He's doubtful 
Been revealed that he is Doubtful For Saturday
They have a lot of average players
Far too much dead wood
We have a predictable midfield
We don't use the ball both well enough or quick enough
I think he is one who is not good enough
he's a rare breed of useless
It's sad
It's sad but I can't see any of the young players from today who will make it
The problem is we picked so many average players to start today
His flicks and passes were useless
It was a fairly unexciting debut
Bit disappointed with him tonight if I'm honest
I think he was given shit instructions
He is shit
It was one of those poor overall team performances
His inability
That is ludicrous
didn't have a good game
He didn't do what he was told
poor game from him too much pressure on the lad to perform not ready
we have too many average midfielders
agree we flopped at Euro's but players must shoulder some blame amongst others were so bad was let down
there wasn't a leader
I disagree He is not a top player
Too many players aren't good enough
that was slightly annoying about tonight
it doesn't make any sense
Unfortunately 
He struggles to beat his man
His crossing of late has been dreadful as well
Tonight's showing was abysmal
if it is lack of motivation
we lack creativity in the middle
not really that good enough
which is a shame
has impacted massively on our peformances
This is a disappointing time for us
Such a lack of determination
He did everything wrong today
You taking the piss or are you actually that simple
Fuck off you arrogant prick
but he was quite frankly shit
his final ball at times was very poor
He must take a bit of a blame
Two poor games in a row
He was poor hasn't delivered in a few months now
Seemed to lack the intensity
that miss is awful
he was frustrating
I really don't like these slumps of form
there is a lot of inexperience of our right-backs
He is much slower
He has lost much pace
his pace is gone
Horrible injury
we have had so many injuries
that injury was horrible
abysmal injury record
pretty dull game
I am so bored
this game is so boring
we've played some poor football
a very stupid thing to do
lacked creativity
He went through the injuries
he isn't sharp enough
missed almost an entire season with a serious long-term illness
Part of the problem
He was a coward
The assistant's in the game are shit
Basically the ref bottled it today
unable to play
Many of us lack a proper understanding of football
clouded some of our judgement 
We do have a few absolute ballbags in our ranks
The level of negativity here has been astounding
Spoilt beyond belief
doom and gloom feckers after a couple of shitty results
a few are spoilt by success
fat Geordie bastard
fans who booed their team off
little enjoyment from the game
we have a few spoilt pricks
The atmosphere is appalling sometimes
Definitely a lot of spoiled twats on here
My main issue is with arrogant spoilt ungrateful fans
playing shite
they are as spoilt as us
continuously booed their team off
for falling short
My gripe was with spoilt and unrealistic people
who leave before the end are the worst
talking bollocks as usual
A bit of knee jerking going on
It's sort of ruining it for me
are generally deluded to fuck
I was disappointed and frustrated too
You pathetic sad twat
A lot of us are complaining
We have as big a percentage of tossers
was a bit sloppy
Below par 
for this negativity but fuck it
The negativity here is stupid and retarded granted it was a poor performance
That was the worst performance result in the
probably even worse
His form this season has been fairly worrying
I was angry
He was dire as well
he is fucking apologising
completely unbalanced side
was really disappointing
that was dire
seem to have a slump
it's annoying to lose
the doom merchants are out in force
absolute abortion of a team
He is shit
Awful month 
Awful week
Awful game
team has played poorly
And it has been a rather poor week for the club
frankly an embarassment
WUM
having an awful season
missing a sitter
missed a sitter
worst mistake i've seen him make
lack of reaction was terrible
he has a big weakness
worst individual performance
had a fucking mare
that was a terrible decision
Players elbowing others and no cards given
facepalm
Shit decision
Bollocks
he has grown Tiresome
ridiculous stuff
He got at least one of the calls wrong
Gets away with absolutely everything
What an absolute joke of a decision
he robs us
He's so fucking consistently shit It's actually mind boggling
mind boggling
Idiot of a ref
he gets demoted
Hate the man with a passion Thoroughly incompetent
one of the worst refereeing performances I've ever seen
It genuinely bemuses me
this shit will continue
The fuckers should be forced
if they can't then get demoted to lower leagues
becoming a parody of a ref
He is so bad I actually remember him being a terrible referee
has made the officiating worse
bad decision
He's incompetent and inconsistent
one of those players who is just so despicable
and I hated it
Pathetic
is a huge twat
that's a despicable reaction
Pathetic stuff from
is a fucking tool
I fucking hate
Pathetic from the interviewer as well
ruined again
what a fucking cheat
It's shocking stuff
typical cheating
what an utter cnut
You know what's even worse
and seen this terrible decision
Fuck off you fool twat
He should fuck off
such a joke twat
terrible decisions
It killed the game
buzzkill
this has killed the game
joke fool fucking asshole
whinging diving cheat
dives diving
is tragic
Don't recall ever behaving like a bad-tempered little brat Why he's not suspended
He is absolute dogshit
is beyond me
He was demoted
was among the worst i've seen
He's a poor referee
That incompetent twat
struggling offensively looks clueless at times make too many mistakes bad passes
I was rather shocked
his fault
He's just a very bad referee
incompetent people
IMO it was shocking
Far more annoying
He's having a run of poor form
He has the wrong attitude
Slightly overrated
When he's bad he can be bad
he wasnt as good as
fat useless scouse twat
his injury
Now bad is shocking+ we have no cm
that bastard is horrible
He's been below his best
had bad injury problems
terrible injury
this is part of his problem
constantly moaning and threatening to leave
does everything wrong
shower of shites
thought he was poor today
a bit frustrating
he's angry and pissed
Shit first touch
his crossing is terrible
him starting is a bad sign
I can't believe he's starting he is terrible
We lose games when he is in the starting lineup
bad season for him
bad he was really bad 
such a bad season 
his crossing is so bad
his crossing has deteriorated
he is a horrible player
bad player bad attitude
why has his crossing been so bad
money grabbing prostitue shagging fat scouse cunt
absurd suggestion 
just awful
I don't think is world class
Sure hope doesn't mess up
IMO the team is playing horribly at the moment
this is the last time he should play for us
he's been terrible in the last couple of games
fuck off you arrogant fucking bastard
Starting XI for Cunt Cunt Cunt Cunt Cunt Cunt Cunt Cunt Cunt Fat Cunt Cuntarito Ref
that bastard can't do anything right
has suffered suspected ankle ligament damage
Bad news for has suffered suspected ankle ligament damage
horrible news for us
I hate those kind of news magnificent
latest news confirms his injury
those news suck
that damage is horrible
so much damage been done recently
dive was even worse than yesterday That's how bad it was
not happy with the refs today
That's rubbish
So much negativity Football would be a tad boring
What a shitty draw
All I know is that he doesn't know shit about football
torn ligaments in his ankle and will be out for three to four weeks Doesn't sound so bad
Striker problems already at 
That's bad news for the kids
Knowing are going to win the league is bad but knowing they'll knock us out of the FA cup is worse
too bad he twisted his ankles
should look to retire in my opinion He is slower than ever and making mistakes weekly it seems
I hate when it takes them so long to make the draw in the FA Cup
I haven't got a clue why he uses him he is useless
we're fucked in the league arrogant bastards
not happy with that you all are fools
kept the ball too long too bad
must be very furious with FA cup draw
no one gives a shit about u muppet
one of the most shitty results ever we're shit
why do we always get the tough draws
small club mentality that
he's garbage hope he doesn't start
what was he thinking when he picked this side to face them
I'm sure he will fuck up somehow shit player
this has been the most shit performance in the league with this lineup don't know what happened
very tough game for us don't see us winning this one
I thought he was very poor today
I hate his fucking face
times are bad for us these days you're right about that
He is old useless and shit he should retire
totally ineffective players aren't just tidy
Shame not starting
Could he be more shit
manager shit players shit team shit stadium shit referee shit every one was shit
he is too young and had an awful time
have failed to score for 485 minutes in all competitons
worst player in the world
Why would anyone sign that shit of a player
That 6-1 defeat is a rare occurence It wont be that open the next time we meet them you're a fool if you think City will annihilate
You know what's worse? If #MUFC fail to beat they could end up playing on thursdays
horrible miss how did he miss that 
he never fucking scores
